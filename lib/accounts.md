# Account Management

When you first sign up for Vercel, you'll create an account. This account is used to manage your Vercel resources. Vercel has three types of plans:

*   [Hobby](/docs/plans/hobby)
*   [Pro](/docs/plans/pro)
*   [Enterprise](/docs/plans/enterprise)

Each plan offers different features and resources, allowing you to choose the right plan for your needs.

When signing up for Vercel, you can choose to sign up with an email address or a Git provider.

## [Sign up with email](#sign-up-with-email)

To sign up with email:

1.  Enter your email address to receive the six-digit one-time password (OTP)
2.  Enter the OTP to proceed with logging in successfully.

When signing up with your email, no Git provider will be connected by default. See [login methods and connections](#login-methods-and-connections) for information on how to connect a Git provider. If no Git provider is connected, you will be asked to verify your account on every login attempt.

## [Sign up with a Git provider](#sign-up-with-a-git-provider)

You can sign up with any of the following supported Git providers:

*   [GitHub](/docs/git/vercel-for-github)
*   [GitLab](/docs/git/vercel-for-gitlab)
*   [Bitbucket](/docs/git/vercel-for-bitbucket)

Authorize Vercel to access your Git provider account. This will be the default login connection on your account.

Once signed up you can manage your login connections in the [authentication section](/account/authentication) of your dashboard.

## [Login methods and connections](#login-methods-and-connections)

You can manage your login connections in the Authentication section of [your account settings](/account/authentication). To find this section:

1.  Select your profile picture near the top-right of the dashboard
2.  Select Settings in the dropdown that appears
3.  Select Authentication in the list near the left side of the page

![The Authentication section of your account settings.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1704990083%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Faccounts%2Fauthentication-page-light.png&w=1920&q=75)![The Authentication section of your account settings.](/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.vercel.com%2Fimage%2Fupload%2Fv1704990083%2Fdocs-assets%2Fstatic%2Fdocs%2Faccounts%2Fauthentication-page-dark.png&w=1920&q=75)

The Authentication section of your account settings.

### [Login with passkeys](#login-with-passkeys)

Passkeys allow you to log into your Vercel account using biometrics such as face or fingerprint recognition, PINs, hardware security keys, and more.

To add a new passkey:

1.  From the dashboard, click your account avatar and select Settings. In your [account settings](/account/authentication), go to the Authentication item
2.  Under Add New, select the Passkey button and then click Continue
3.  Select the authenticator of preference. This list depends on your browser and your eligible devices. By default, Vercel will default to a password manager if you have one installed on your browser and will automatically prompt you to save the passkey
4.  Follow the instructions on the device or with the account you've chosen as an authenticator

When you're done, the passkey will appear in a list of login methods on the Authentication page, alongside your other connections.

### [Logging in with SAML Single Sign-On](#logging-in-with-saml-single-sign-on)

SAML Single Sign-On enables you to log into your Vercel Enterprise team with your organization's identity provider which manages your credentials.

Available only to Enterprise teams, this option can be configured by your team's administrator. To sign up for an Enterprise plan, [contact sales](/contact/sales).

### [Choosing a connection when creating a project](#choosing-a-connection-when-creating-a-project)

When you create an account on Vercel, you will be prompted to create a project by either importing a Git repository or using a template.

Either way, you must connect a Git provider to your account, which you'll be able to use as a login method in the future.

### [Using an existing login connection](#using-an-existing-login-connection)

Your Hobby team on Vercel can have only one login connection per third-party service. For example, you can only log into your Hobby team with a single GitHub account.

For multiple logins from the same service, create a new Vercel Hobby team.

## [Teams](#teams)

Teams on Vercel let you collaborate with other members on projects and access additional resources.

### [Team membership](#team-membership)

You can join a Vercel team through an invitation from a [team owner](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role), automatic addition by a team's [identity provider](/docs/saml), or by requesting access yourself. To request access, you can push a commit to a private Git repository owned by the team.

### [Leaving a team](#leaving-a-team)

You can't leave a team if you are the last remaining [owner](/docs/rbac/access-roles#owner-role) or the last confirmed [member](/docs/rbac/access-roles#member-role).

To leave a team:

1.  If there isn't another owner for your team, you must assign a different confirmed member as the team owner
2.  Go to your team's dashboard and select the Settings tab
3.  Scroll to the Leave Team section and select the Leave Team button
4.  Click Confirm
5.  If you are the only remaining member, you should delete the team instead

### [Default team](#default-team)

Your default team will be used when you make a request through the [API](/docs/rest-api) or [CLI](/docs/cli) and donâ€™t specify a specific team. It will also be the team shown whenever you first log in to Vercel or navigate to `/dashboard`. The first Hobby or Pro team you create will automatically be nominated as the default team.

#### [How to change your default team](#how-to-change-your-default-team)

If you delete, leave, or are removed from your default team, Vercel will automatically choose a new default team for you. However, you may want to choose a default team yourself. To do that:

1.  Navigate to [vercel.com/account/settings](https://vercel.com/account/settings)
2.  Under Default Team, select your new default team from the dropdown
3.  Press Save

### [Find your team ID](#find-your-team-id)

Your Team ID is a unique and unchangeable identifier that's automatically assigned when your team is created.

There are a couple of methods you can use to locate your Team ID:

*   Vercel API: Use the [Vercel API](/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/teams/list-all-teams) to retrieve your Team ID
*   Dashboard: Find your Team ID directly from your team's Dashboard on Vercel:
    *   Navigate to the following URL, replacing `your_team_name_here` with your actual team's name: `https://vercel.com/teams/your_team_name_here/settings#team-id`. If you're unable to locate your Team ID using the URL method, follow these steps:
    *   Open your team's dashboard and head over to the Settings tab
    *   Choose General from the left-hand navigation
    *   Scroll down to the Team ID section and your Team ID will be there ready for you to copy
